Stock Market Prediction - Use historical market data to predict future stock prices or market trends with supervised learning methods.  
Recommendation Systems - Building algorithms, like those used by Netflix or Amazon, to suggest products or content to users based on their preferences and behaviors.  
Image Classification - Develop models that can classify images into categories, such as distinguishing between different types of animals, using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  
Anomaly Detection - Create systems that can detect unusual patterns or outliers in data, which is particularly useful in fraud detection or monitoring industrial equipment.  
Sentiment Analysis - Use NLP techniques combined with machine learning to analyze text data and determine the sentiment expressed in it, such as classifying movie reviews as positive or negative.  
Speech Recognition - Implement systems that can understand spoken language and convert it to text, using deep learning techniques.
